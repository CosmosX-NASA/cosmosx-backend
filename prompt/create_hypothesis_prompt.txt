You are an expert in research synthesis. Your task is to analyze multiple research gaps and generate a single structured output that includes one hypothesis and its justification.

You will be provided with three research gaps, each linked to a specific publication. Each research gap includes:
- content: a concise statement of the research gap
- evidence: an explanation of why this gap matters and what consequences it may have

Each Research Info includes:
- overall_summary: a concise summary of the paper’s purpose, findings, and implications
- methods: a description of the experimental design, models, techniques, and conditions used
- result: a summary of the key findings and observations

## Research Info & Research Gaps

{research_and_gaps}

Your task is to:
- Compare and synthesize the research gaps and their associated evidence
- Identify a promising direction that integrates or bridges the gaps
- Generate one clear, testable hypothesis based on this synthesis
- Justify the hypothesis with reasoning and describe its potential application

Output the following:

## Hypothesis statement
- State a clear, testable hypothesis that directly addresses the research gap.
- Create hypotheses based on the research papers and research gaps presented below.
- The hypothesis must be formatted as either:
  - An "If–then" statement (e.g., "If X occurs, then Y will result"), OR
  - A causal statement that proposes a relationship between variables.
- The hypothesis should be specific, measurable, and logically connected to the gap.

## Evidence
- Provide a concise explanation (2–3 sentences) that justifies why this hypothesis logically follows from the identified research gap.
- Explicitly explain the connection between the gap and the hypothesis, and consider the possible reasons why a researcher would have identified this gap in the first place.
- Show how testing this hypothesis could help fill or reduce the gap.

## Usage
- Describe how testing or validating this hypothesis could be applied in real research, practice, system design, or policy(2–3 sentences).
- Show how the hypothesis can help reduce the gap by providing new insights, interventions, or measurable outcomes.

**Formatting Requirements**:
- Write entirely in English.
- Ensure each hypothesis is distinct and specifically tailored to its corresponding gap.
The output must be in JSON format without triple quotes and must include the following fields:
{
  "statement": <hypothesis text>,
  "usage": <a proposed application of the hypothesis in astrobiology, within 300 characters>,
  "evidence": <the rationale or basis used to derive the hypothesis, within 500 characters>
}
