', 'This study investigated sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity using Sprague-Dawley rats, focusing on mechanisms of aortic stiffening. Researchers observed that female rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU), a model for simulated microgravity, developed greater arterial stiffening compared to males. This increased arterial stiffening in females was associated with lower levels of aortic G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and increased oxidative stress markers. The administration of a GPER agonist, G1, reversed the HLU-induced increase in pulse wave velocity in female Sprague-Dawley rats, suggesting GPER''s protective role against arterial stiffening in this sex-specific context. The findings highlight the importance of understanding sex-specific responses to simulated microgravity for future space missions.', 'i) Experimental Data: Socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used, with body weight, organ weight, body composition, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and cardiac function data collected.

IRE1 unconventionally splices bZIP transcription factors, Xbp-1, bZIP60 , and Hac1 mRNA in mammals, plants, and yeast respectively. The spliced bZIP transcription factor enters into the nucleus to regulate UPR target genes. In addition, two distinct arms mediated by PERK and ATF6 regulate mammalian UPR. ATF6 is an ER transmembrane transcription factor. ER stress triggers the relocation of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is undergone proteolytic cleavage. Subsequently, the transcription factor domain of ATF6 enters into the nucleus to modulate transcription of UPR target genes. Two functional homologues of ATF6, bZIP17 and bZIP28, exist in plants. PERK, an ER transmembrane protein kinase is identified only in animals. Upon ER stress, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (elF2α), which leads to a transient inhibition of general protein translation and selective translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Under irremediable ER stress, PERK-elF2α-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-JNK initiate apoptosis in mammals.

A dissociation of IRE1α from BiP due to an elevated level of unfolded protein in the ER leads to activation of IRE1α. The IRE1α activating processes include its auto-phosphorylation, conformational change, and higher order assembly. IRE1α directs cell fate decision through unconventional splicing and Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD). To prevent increasing demand of ER protein folding, IRE1α conducts RIDD to degrade the transcripts of ER-translocating proteins. In parallel, IRE1α unconventionally splices the transcript of Xbp-1 transcription factor. The spliced XBP-1 enters into the nucleus to transcriptionally reprogram UPR target genes, including ER chaperones. Under irremediable ER stress, IRE1α ceases to splice Xbp-1 mRNA. Instead, IRE1α operates RIDD on selective UPR target genes including BiP to enhance the ER stress intensity. Once the ER stress intensity reaches its threshold, IRE1α represses anti- Casp2 microRNA, miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96, and miR-125b through RIDD.

The diagram illustrates that in addition to IRE1, bZIP28 and bZIP60, also bZIP17 plays a role in the control of UPR target genes in Arabidopsis, as recently proposed [ 27 ]. A role for the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, AGB1, in modulating the UPR has also been reported [ 17•• , 53 ]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that NAC TFs participate to the plant UPR. NAC are plant-specific transcription factors, among which at least 13 members are predicted to be membrane-anchored in Arabidopsis. In condition of stress, the plasma membrane NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6 relocates to the nucleus, and the overexpression of a protein deletion devoid of the membrane anchor leads to activation of UPR genes [ 54•• ]. Another membrane-anchored NAC TF, NAC089, participates to ER stress responses by relocating from the ER to the nucleus and regulating PCD-related gene expression [ 55• ]. NAC089 expression is regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60; bZIP60 also regulates directly the expression of NAC062 . Finally the cytosolic NAC103, whose expression is directly regulated by bZIP60, is involved in controlling UPR gene expression [ 26• ]. The evidence that plant-specific NAC TFs have a role in stress responses support that in addition to common routes plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress defense that, as in the case of NAC062, may also depend on the activity of TFs that are localized to the membrane organelles other than the ER. Interestingly also, it has been recently suggested that unspliced AtbZIP60 may have a role in modulating the expression of BiP3 in conditions of ER stress [ 27 ]. Phosphorylation of the elf2α may occur in a hypothetical PERK-like pathway for ER stress responses. See also the main text for additional details.

A schematic diagram outlining how (A) suppression or (B) over-expression of CGR2 and CGR3 gene expression affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth in Arabidopsis is presented. Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 reduces the degree of pectin methylation, which leads to an increase in cell-to-cell adhesion, cation-mediated cross linking of GalUA, and consequent hardening of cell walls. CGR2 over-expression increases the degree of pectin methylation, which allows cell expansion through reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and cation-mediated cross linking. We propose that pectin methyltransferase enzyme, through its ability to directly alter cell expansion, determines the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth versus growth in terms of LMA . For example, while more C is partitioned to growth in terms of LMA in the CGR2 and CGR3 double knockout mutant, in the CGR2 over-expression line more C is partitioned to leaf area growth. An increase in LMA leads to enhanced area-based respiration and a reduction in leaf area contribute to a reduction in whole plant photosynthesis. Collectively, this results in a reduction in C available for growth and consequently a decrease in overall plant growth; an opposite trend is seen in CGR2OX. Thus, CGR2 and CGR3 , through their ability to alter the degree of methylated pectin in the cell wall of the mesophyll cells, determine how photosynthate is utilized to grow the plant. In other words, CGR2 - and CGR3 -mediated pectin methylesterification affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth by regulating the proportions of C that is partitioned to leaf area growth and LMA . Final overall growth mainly depends on the expression patterns of CGR2 and CGR3 and how much C is partitioned to area growth and LMA and not on area-based photosynthesis.

Plastid stress promotes the buildup of MEcPP (2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate), which through an unknown mechanism, activates CAMTA3 (Calmodulin biding transcriptional activator 3) inducing transcription of bZIP60 . 2. BiP ER luminal proteins bind unfolded proteins. The buildup of unfolded proteins leads to activation of IRE1 mediated splicing of bZIP60 , which is then potentially ligated by the RNA ligase RLG1. The spliced bZIP60 is a nuclear localized transcription factor which binds to promoters of downstream UPR target genes, Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) although not depicted here, regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. 3. bZIP28 after being freed from BiPs by the presence of unfolded proteins is trafficked to the Golgi in a SAR1a/SEC23-dependent way. S2P proteases cleave the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain. bZIP28 enters the nucleus and acts redundantly with bZIP60 to transcriptionally activate the UPR.', r.id FROM research r WHERE r.pmc_id = 'PMC5415411';

Starting at the edge of this ROI closest to the root tip, ratiometric data from a 5-µm-tall (along the root-shoot axis of the root) × 144-µm-wide region covering the cortex and endodermis was averaged and plotted at 0 µm of ROI.

These pre-computed values greatly speed the real-time processing of interactive visualizations within the TOAST user interface. The identifiers in the raw data, such as Transcript ID from RNAseq, Probe ID for Microarray, or TAIR ID are translated to their unique Entrez and Ensembl IDs to allow for uniform indexing within TOAST itself and to facilitate passing of analyzed data produced by TOAST analyses to exterior sites and tools. Within TOAST, the strings of molecular ID''s from a dataset are both directly transferred to a series of data visualization and exploration tools and are imported into a series of analytical packages accessing a range of databases that have been imported into the TOAST environment.

B, Change in electrical potential of a VP is typified by a sharp depolarization and slow repolarization often with AP-like spikes superimposed. The magnitude of the VP diminishes with distance from the originating stimulus. C, Model for possible series of events related to wound-induced VP and Ca 2+ wave. Dashed lines represent speculative regulatory activities. Cation channel activation (through ROS and/or ligand binding) triggers Ca 2+ influx with contributions from CNGCs and potentially from plasma membrane-localized GLRs. The molecular identity of the proposed ROS-activated Ca 2+ -permeable plasma membrane channel in this system remains unknown. GLRs on internal membranes, along with TPC1 on the tonoplast, may be operating in an amplification system that reinforces the cytosolic Ca 2+ change. When coupled with Cl − efflux and inactivation of H + -ATPases, these events lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Ca 2+ -dependent processes would be likely candidates to coordinate these activities but precise molecular machineries await to be defined. The accompanying rise in apoplastic pH from inhibition of the H + -ATPase further activates putative GLR Ca 2+ conductances at the plasma membrane. The resultant cytoplasmic Ca 2+ elevation should then lead to activation of RBOHs and further apoplastic ROS production, and thus to a feed-forward loop supporting cell-to-cell propagation of the signal. D, Slow influx of ROS into the cytosol via aquaporins could then inactivate TPC1, inhibiting the cytosolic Ca 2+ amplifier. Repolarization would then be driven by H + -ATPase reactivation and K + release, restoring the membrane potential. A reduction in apoplastic pH would inhibit GLR activity, further contributing to the resetting of the system.', r.id FROM research r WHERE r.pmc_id = 'PMC8133610';

Damage at the wound site (putatively signaled by release of glutamate from damaged cells; Toyota et al., 2018 ) triggers VP propagation and a wave of increased ROS and Ca 2+ that moves through the vasculature to distal leaves where it spreads through plasmodesmatal connections to trigger systemic defenses ( Toyota et al., 2018 ). Transmission is dependent on the action of the GLR ion channels and the plasma membrane H + pump AHA1. B and C, In the systemic leaves, the Ca 2+ rise in the nucleus of target cells triggers phosphorylation of the JAV1 transcriptional inhibitor in a calmodulin-dependent manner. This change then targets JAV1 for ubiquitinylation by the JUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26S proteasome.

These data are representative of more than three independent experiments. C, Col-0 and cax3 plants demonstrated elevated H 2 O 2 fluorescence using the cell permeable dye H 2 DCFDA in rosette leaves post anoxia compared to cax1. In the presence of ROS, H 2 DCF is oxidized to DCF, giving the fluorescence in Col-0 and cax3 . Three-week-old plants were exposed to anoxic conditions for 8 h in dark. Following anoxia stress, mature whole rosette leaves were detached from the plants and were used for staining, Scale bar = 250 µM. Fluorescence signals quantified by ImageJ are given in the lower panel. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared to pre-anoxic conditions using Student’s t test in Excel (* P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.005). Although there is variability among plants, the trends were consistent. Data are a representative three independent experiments and error bars indicate standard error of the mean. D, Cell death in leaves as measured by trypan blue staining was higher in Col-0 and cax3 post anoxia compared to cax1. Plants belonging to nine-rosette leaf stage were subject to anoxia as described in Figure 1A and leaves were sampled 7 h after the plants were returned to normoxia. Nine leaves were used to quantify the cell death intensity. The letters indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between two columns (level of significance 95%) as calculated from Student’s t test in Excel.

Exposure of tissues to elements of the spaceflight environment such as microgravity and radiation (and potentially other unknown factors) leads to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (NOS), increased levels of pro-inflammatory signals, and downregulation of endogenous antioxidant defenses. This leads to excess ROS/NOS due to an imbalance between endogenous antioxidant protein levels and ROS/NOS production. Excess ROS/NOS leads to oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and DNA which in turn result in deficits in tissue function and structural integrity. Other non-redox signaling processes may also contribute to these deficits. Some exogenous antioxidants found in the diet may block the increases in ROS/NOS levels and inflammatory signals, thereby preventing oxidative damage. It remains to be elucidated whether inflammation causes ROS production and/or vice versa in the context of spaceflight, and whether oxidative damage mediates or results from progressive tissue degeneration as a consequence of spaceflight.

Normal (wt) animals complete their third instar larval stage by day ∼5, and proceed to ∼5 d of pupal development. Pupae containing pharate animals are visible by day ∼10, and they eclose shortly thereafter as adult flies. Wt animals are shown as a reference to the left of B and C .

All of the larvae collected in this summary were mobile and thus alive. Hypomorphic mutants could pupate and even advance to the pharate stage; however, it is likely that some of the pupae shown at the latest days are deceased.

Under normal gravity conditions , the gravity vector is sensed in statocytes of the root cap (“professional” cells), and the signal is transduced through the regulation of the auxin polar transport in the root. In meristematic cells, auxin regulates meristematic competence through its interaction with a number of growth coordinators appearing in the figure ( nucleolin is a regulator of ribosome biogenesis which interacts, in turn, with cell cycle regulators; E2FB is a member of a family of transcription factors, regulated by auxin, which induces cell proliferation and growth; cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are major elements of cell cycle checkpoints controlling DNA replication and entry into mitosis). In addition, other mechanisms of gravity sensing and transduction must exist in “non-professional” cells, i.e., cells not specialized in gravity sensing, and, eventually, promote a similar response in meristematic/proliferating cells, as inferred from the results obtained in biological systems devoid of statocytes and statoliths. These mechanisms are poorly known at present. In microgravity conditions , auxin polar transport is inhibited, at least partially, auxin levels are high at meristems and growth coordinators are, in general, down regulated. The response is the disruption of meristematic competence in proliferating cells. Photoactivation by light (especially by red light), sensed and mediated by phytochromes (especially PHYB), is known to produce down regulation of auxin responsive genes and upregulation of many growth coordinators in meristematic cells, by means of direct and/or indirect mechanisms. These effects may counteract the gravitational stress in root meristematic cells in conditions of microgravity. Red arrows indicate down regulation, black arrows indicate up regulation and blue arrow indicates unknown effect.', r.id FROM research r WHERE r.pmc_id = 'PMC4211383';

However, partial gravity, as well as Earth gravity levels, were sufficient to produce the seedling orientation according to the gravity vector.', r.id FROM research r WHERE r.pmc_id = 'PMC9605285';

Seedlings were grown for 4 days under a white light photoperiod (16 h/8 h), and were then either photoactivated with continuous unidirectional red light for an additional 2 days, or kept in darkness. ( a ) Global transcriptomic patterns obtained with the bioinformatic tool called Gene Expression Dynamic Inspector (GEDI) of Col-0 wild-type samples grown under different conditions. Genes showing similar degrees of expression were treated together, attributed a color code, and are presented as a tile or pixel in the diagram. Upper row: full genome. Lower row: differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microgravity, with respect to 1 g . The pattern significantly changed from red-light-1 g conditions to dark-micro- g conditions, but it was reverted in micro- g with red light photoactivation. Reversion was higher for the full genome than for DEGs only. ( b ) Comparison of the transcriptomic effects of a change in illumination, at constant micro- g (left), and of a change in g at constant red light (right). Diagrams show the percentages of upregulated and downregulated genes in the different ontology groups. ( c ): GEDI maps, under different conditions of light and gravity, of the comparison in gene expression of the Col-0 wild-type and the nuc2 mutant, defective in a gene participating in the stress response mechanisms. Differences in gene expression between the two genotypes in each condition were used to estimate the stress of this condition.', r.id FROM research r WHERE r.pmc_id = 'PMC9605285';

These environmental factors are crucial to understanding results and can drastically vary by experiment. Given these complexities, understanding the environmental factors during a mission and the exact experimental design (including acquiring and analyzing the data), and standardizing them across agencies will be crucial to the development of aerospace multi omic analyses.

Medium was loaded in chamber A (2.7 mL in three chamber design, 5 mL in two chamber design) and cell inoculum was loaded in chamber B (0.5 mL). In the three chamber design, chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL of fixative or fresh medium. Chambers were sequentially mixed on a predetermined schedule by depressing a plunger, and consequently the column of reagents and septa, to allow mixing of reagents through the bypass in the glass barrel. All eight FPAs within a GAP were processed as a unit. At the conclusion of the experimental operations, the FPAs were stored within the GAP at the prescribed temperature. ( B ) FEP bags were used for the Micro-14/FEP payload, allowing for dilution (D 1 and D 2 bags) and serial subculture procedures. To activate growth, yeast (1 mL, 4 × 10 4 cells/mL) was injected into the first Large FEP bag (Bag A containing 11 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. At the end of this growth stage, an aliquot was removed and diluted 20-fold (Bag A D1 ). From this dilution, the next Large FEP bag was inoculated (0.25 mL into Bag B containing 11.8 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. This process was repeated until the cells had been cultured for five days (through Bag E). On each of the first four days, samples were also prepared to analyze antifungal sensitivity. For these samples, the dilution series was extended from the D 1 dilution bag to the D 2 dilution bag (1:10) and aliquots (0.2 mL) from D 2 were used to inoculate Small FEP bags (A1–A12, B1–B12, etc.) containing antifungal agents or control medium (2.8 mL).

A detailed description of STARMAPs is provided in the “Methods” section. Briefly, to compare group differences in the gut microbiome in one dataset to another, STARMAPs first performs PCA using samples from the first dataset alone (e.g., RR-1 data, left) and tests whether samples were segregated by the groups of interest (e.g., Flight vs. Ground) along the PCA axes. Then, samples from the second dataset (e.g., STS-135 data, RIGHT) are projected onto the same PCA axes and are tested for their group segregation along these PCA axes. As a third test, STARMAPs also evaluates the similarity in the directions of changes in the two datasets. It draws a line through the centers of the two groups of samples in each dataset to represent the group differences and tests whether the cosine of the angle, θ , between the lines in two datasets is significantly different from 0. When cos θ = 1, the microbiome changes in the two datasets are in exactly the same direction, and when cos θ = − 1, the microbiome changes in the two datasets are in exactly the opposite directions. Finally, STARMAPs uses an omnibus P value to summarize the three tests above to evaluate the overall similarity. Note that, while the graphs depict only PC1 and PC2, the tests were performed with all PCA axes. b Microbiome variations during RR-1 were compared to those induced by 10 days (left) or 30 days (right) of exposures to high-LET radiation exposure on Earth. c Microbiome variations in RR-1 mice were compared to those in rats exposed to low-LET radiation while fed on diets with either an adequate iron content (left) or a high-iron content (right). Note that STARMAPs uses random samplings from the Dirichlet distribution to estimate abundances of microbial taxa detected in one dataset but not the other. As a result, each time when comparing RR-1 data to another dataset, PCA of RR-1 samples gives very similar but not identical segregation patterns. Results shown here are at the species level, and similar results were observed at higher taxonomic levels as well (Additional file 1 ).
